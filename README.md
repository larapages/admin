# Admin
An easy to implement, lightweight yet complete Laravel 5.5+ admin panel/backend and media/filemanager.
Basically it's a web-based content editor for your Laravel models. It's very easy to integrate into your existing Laravel application.

nickdekruijk/admin is the next evolution of [nickdekruijk/larapages](https://github.com/nickdekruijk/larapages) which won't be updated anymore but will remain online for historical reference.

## Installation
To install the package use

`composer require nickdekruijk/admin`

## Configuration
After installing for the first time publish the config file with 

`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=config --provider="NickDeKruijk\Admin\ServiceProvider"` 

A default config file called `admin.php` will be available in your Laravel `app/config` folder. See this file for more details. Some important configuration options are highlighted below.

### /admin
By default you access admin panel by adding /admin to the URL of your website/application. For example https://www.domain.com/admin
You can change this path by changing the `adminpath` configuration option.

### Add 'admin_role' to your users
Admin uses the auth middleware from Laravel. To determine if a user has permission you need to add a `admin_role` column to your User model and table. You can change the column name with the `role_column` configuration option.
A migration is included with the package so you can run `php artisan migrate` to add the column. If you don't want to use the included migration you can disable it by changing the configuration option `role_column_migration` to false. 

### Configure modules and roles
The most important configuration option is the `modules` array. The default will get you started but you most likely need to change a lot depending on your application. Each module is identified by a unique slug and it has a [fontawesome.io](https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/) icon and opens a view. It also has a title (defaults to the slug) that you can localise (e.g. title_nl). All other options are view/module specific and will be documented in the future. The slugs are also used to define the permissions in the `roles` array so if you add or remove modules you probably need to change the roles too.

### Login routes
By default Admin will register login and logout routes and use a simple login screen without registration, 'Remember me' or password resets.
If your application already uses authentication your routes/web.php file will probably overwrite these routes but you probably want to disable the Admin routes by changing configuration option `auth_routes` to false.

### Creating a new user
If your application has no users Admin provides an artisan console command to create or update a user with a random password and assign a role.

`php artisan admin:user <email> [<role>]`

Role must match one of the roles defined in the configuration. The default role for a new user is "admin". 

## FAQ

### How do I localize the validation messages?
You could use the package [arcanedev/laravel-lang](https://github.com/ARCANEDEV/LaravelLang), just run `composer require arcanedev/laravel-lang`.
